### Plan:
Task: Gather information about the `compose-post-service` microservice, including its READY status, CPU/Memory usage, and P99 latency.

Steps:
1. Get the current READY status of all pods in the `compose-post-service` deployment using the `kubectl get pods -n social-network` command.
2. Check the current CPU and Memory usage of the `compose-post-service` pods via Prometheus queries.
3. Query Prometheus for P99 latency of the `compose-post-service` over the last 5 minutes.
4. Report the collected data to the manager.

### Step 1: Get the current READY status of all pods
Let me start by fetching the READY status of all pods in the `compose-post-service` deployment. 

```bash
kubectl get pods -n social-network
```

### Plan:

**Task**: Analyze the root cause of high P99 latency (between 211.15ms and 223.93ms) for the `compose-post-service` and provide insights.

**Steps**:
1. Investigate the historical P99 latency trend by querying Prometheus for a broader time frame.
2. Analyze the "CPU Usage" and "Memory Usage" metrics to correlate potential resource constraints with latency issues.
3. Check for any errors or unusual logs associated with the `compose-post-service` pods.
4. Investigate the current pod's resource limits and usage to determine whether the service is hitting its defined resource limits.
5. Analyze latency data to check for traffic surges or abnormal behaviors.
6. Summarize findings with potential causes of high P99 latency.

---

### Step 1: Investigate historical P99 latency trend.

First, we’ll look at the P99 latency trend for the past 30 minutes to identify any patterns or spikes in the latency metric.

**Query Prometheus**:
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promql = 'histogram_quantile(0.99,sum(rate(compose_post_latency_ms_bucket[5m])) by (le))'
result = query_prometheus(promql=promql, duration='30m', step='1m')
print(result)

### Analysis:
The error suggests that the `query_prometheus` function call is missing the correct parameter format. The function expects a parameter named `promQL`, but it was mistakenly passed as `promql`.

---

### Updated Step 1: Investigate historical P99 latency trend.

I will correct the function call by using the proper parameter name `promQL`.

**Query Prometheus (with the corrected parameter)**:
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'histogram_quantile(0.99,sum(rate(compose_post_latency_ms_bucket[5m])) by (le))'
result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='30m', step='1m')

Next speaker: compose-post-service-assistant

compose-post-service-assistant (to compose-post-service-group-manager):

### Analysis of Historical P99 Latency Trend:
The historical P99 latency data from the last 30 minutes reveals the following:  
1. There was an increase in latency starting around `16:25`, where it reached as high as `298.12ms`.
2. After `16:35`, the latency stabilized but remained consistently high, between `230ms` and `248ms`.
3. At `16:50`, the latency slightly decreased but was still high at `209.92ms`.

This indicates a prolonged period of high latency, which could result from resource constraints, high load, internal service delays, or dependency issues.

---

### Step 2: Correlate resource metrics (CPU & Memory) with latency trends.

We will investigate CPU and memory usage trends for the same 30-minute duration to identify any signs of resource strain.

**Query Prometheus for CPU Usage Trends**:
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'avg by (pod) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{deployment="compose-post-service"}[5m]))'
result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='30m', step='1m')
print(result)

### Analysis of CPU Usage:

The CPU usage remained relatively stable between `0.0075` and `0.0127` cores/second during the 30-minute window. This indicates that CPU resources were unlikely to have caused the high P99 latency. No significant spikes or extreme values were observed.

---

### Step 3: Query Prometheus for Memory Usage Trends.

**Query Prometheus for Memory Usage**:
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'avg by (pod) (rate(container_memory_usage_bytes{deployment="compose-post-service"}[5m]))'
result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='30m', step='1m')
print(result)

### Analysis of Memory Usage:

The memory usage during the last 30 minutes has shown noticeable fluctuations, varying from `33,597 bytes` to a peak of `118,539 bytes`. Key observations are:
1. Several abrupt peaks and troughs point to inconsistent memory usage patterns.
2. Peaks around `16:33 - 16:35` and later periods align with higher latency, indicating potential memory-related constraints.

---

### Step 4: Check for any errors or unusual logs in the `compose-post-service` pods.

We will look into pod logs for errors or any unusual activity to gain insights into the high latency issue.

**Check Pod Logs**:
```bash
kubectl logs compose-post-service-68997776c-gmx7p -n social-network
```

### Analysis of Pod Logs:

The logs only indicate the service startup message, with no noticeable errors, warnings, or unusual activities. This suggests that there are no immediate application-level issues.

---

### Step 5: Verify Current Resource Limits and Compare Against Usage.

We now inspect the CPU and memory limits of the `compose-post-service` pod and check if resource limits are constraining the pod's behavior.

**Check Resource Limits for Pod**:
```bash
kubectl describe pod compose-post-service-68997776c-gmx7p -n social-network

### Analysis of Resource Limits:

The `compose-post-service` pod has the following resource allocations:
- **CPU Limit**: `100m` (0.1 CPU)
- **Memory Limit**: `128Mi`
- **CPU Usage**: Peaked at `0.0127` cores (12.7m), which is well below the limit.
- **Memory Usage**: Peaked at `118,539 bytes` (roughly 116KB), well below the `128Mi` limit.

The analysis reveals that the pod is not hitting its resource limits. Current resource levels appear sufficient and do not seem to be the bottleneck.

---

### Observations:
1. P99 latency increased significantly after `16:25`, with a peak of `298ms`, and remained elevated for the duration of the observed period.
2. CPU usage and memory usage stayed well within resource limits, ruling out resource exhaustion as a cause.
3. No errors or unusual activities are evident in application logs, indicating no immediate application-level issues.

### Possible Root Causes:
- Latency increase may stem from **external dependencies** or **network-related issues** rather than internal resource constraints.
- The issue could also be tied to unusual traffic patterns or workload spikes involving external services (e.g., database or service dependencies).

### Next Steps:
- Investigate external service performance (e.g., database latency or dependency behaviors) in the same time window.
- Analyze network latencies or traffic spikes during the period of high latency.

Would you like to proceed with an investigation into external dependencies and network metrics?

compose-post-service-assistant (to compose-post-service-group-manager):

To summarize, while there are no immediate signs of resource constraints or application-level errors causing the high P99 latency in `compose-post-service`, external dependencies and network-related issues likely contribute to this behavior. Further investigation into dependency performance and network metrics is recommended to pinpoint the root cause.

I will now report the findings.

**Report Result**:
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import report_result

component = 'compose-post-service'
message = (
    "High P99 latency (211.15ms to 298.12ms) observed for compose-post-service. "
    "CPU (0.1 CPU limit) and memory (128Mi limit) usage remain well below limits, "
    "and pod logs show no unusual activity. Resource constraints are ruled out. "
    "Possible causes include external service delays or network issues. Recommended "
    "to investigate external dependencies and network metrics."
)
message_type = 'RESPONSE'

result = report_result(component=component, message=message, message_type=message_type)
print(result)
``` 

Following this, I will terminate the task.

### Analysis of High P99 Latency in `compose-post-service`

#### Key Findings:
1. **Latency Trends**:
   - P99 latency peaked at 298.12ms around `16:25` and remained elevated, ranging between 211.15ms and 248ms for the majority of the observed 30-minute window.

2. **CPU and Memory Metrics**:
   - CPU usage remained stable and well below the allocated limit (0.1 CPU).
   - Memory usage varied but consistently stayed below the allocated limit of 128Mi.
   - Resource exhaustion is not a contributing factor.

3. **Pod Logs**:
   - No errors or unusual activity were found in the application logs during the observed time frame.

4. **Resource Limits**:
   - The pod’s resource allocations appear sufficient, with no evidence of reaching CPU or memory thresholds.

#### Possible Root Causes:
- **External Dependencies**: Delays or bottlenecks in downstream services (e.g., databases or APIs) may contribute to the observed increase in latency.
- **Network Issues**: Potential network latency or connectivity issues during specific time periods may be affecting response times.

#### Recommendations:
1. Investigate the performance of external dependencies (e.g., database query times, API latencies) during the same time window.
2. Analyze network metrics (e.g., traffic spikes, packet loss, or service discovery time) for abnormalities that correspond with the latency increase.
3. Monitor resource usage and latency over a longer duration to confirm this pattern and detect correlations with external factors.

The pod’s internal resource usage and behavior do not indicate any immediate issues, pointing to external factors as the most likely cause of the high P99 latency.
