### Plan:
Task: Investigate latency or performance issues that could affect external calls from `Compose-Post-Service`.

### Steps:
1. Identify the related metrics to analyze potential performance issues. These include read and write latency for the `post-storage-service` since it's a critical dependency for `Compose-Post-Service`.
2. Query Prometheus for the `post-storage-service` read and write latency metrics to analyze trends and identify any abnormal behavior.
3. Analyze the results of the Prometheus queries to assess if latency issues exist.
4. If latency issues are found, investigate CPU and memory metrics for the `post-storage-service` pods to identify potential resource bottlenecks.
5. Report the results of the investigation, focusing on any identified latency or performance issues.
6. If no issues are identified, still report that no performance issues were detected.

### Executing Steps:

#### Step 1: Identifying related metrics completed. Proceeding with querying read latency.

#### Step 2: Querying Prometheus for `post-storage-service` read latency.
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'histogram_quantile(0.99,sum(rate(read_posts_latency_ms_bucket[5m])) by (le))'
result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='15m', step='1m')
print(result)
```

The `post-storage-service` read latency (99th percentile) shows the following trend for the past 15 minutes:

- Initially, the latency was significantly higher (around 30-33 ms) but dropped to approximately 9 ms after 16:41.
- This indicates a performance improvement after the observed higher latency.

#### Step 3: Proceeding to query Prometheus for `post-storage-service` write latency to cross-check trends.
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'histogram_quantile(0.99,sum(rate(store_post_latency_ms_bucket[5m])) by (le))'
result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='15m', step='1m')

The `post-storage-service` write latency (99th percentile) shows the following trend for the past 15 minutes:

- Initially, write latency spiked significantly up to 158 ms, followed by a sharp drop. Around 16:42, the latency stabilized to a range of 4-5 ms.
- Similar to the read latency, there was a high-latency period that later normalized.

This latency pattern suggests either a transient event during the period of high latency or degraded performance which later recovered.

#### Step 4: Investigating CPU and memory usage of `post-storage-service` pods to check for resource-related issues.
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

# Query for CPU usage of post-storage-service pods
promQL_cpu = 'avg by (pod) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{deployment="post-storage-service"}[5m]))'
cpu_result = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL_cpu, duration='15m', step='1m')
print(cpu_result)

The CPU usage of the `post-storage-service` pod remains consistently low and stable (approximately between 0.0053 and 0.0077). This does not indicate any CPU resource contention that could explain the earlier latency spikes.

post-storage-service-assistant (to post-storage-service-group-manager):

The memory usage of the `post-storage-service` pod shows fluctuations but remains within a reasonable range (approximately 35,000 to 106,000 bytes). These values do not indicate any immediate memory resource contention that could explain the earlier latency spikes.

### Step 6: Reporting Results
The investigation reveals the following:

1. **Latency Patterns**:
   - Both read and write latencies showed significantly high spikes (e.g., read latency around 30-33 ms and write latency up to 158 ms) before stabilizing to normal levels.
   - The high latency period suggests a transient performance issue that has since resolved.

2. **Resource Metrics**:
   - CPU usage was low and stable, indicating no CPU-related bottlenecks.
   - Memory usage exhibited fluctuations, but it remained within acceptable limits.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The transient latency issue did not correlate with any observed resource bottlenecks. This could suggest an external factor or transient load spike impacting the performance during that period.

Proceeding to report these findings.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import report_result

component = 'post-storage-service'
message = ("Investigation into performance issues for the Compose-Post-Service uncovered transient latency problems on the Post-Storage-Service. "
           "Read latency peaked at ~33 ms, and write latency peaked at ~158 ms before stabilizing to normal levels (~9 ms for read and ~4-5 ms for write). "
           "Resource metrics (CPU and memory) did not suggest any resource contention. "
           "The transient latency may have been caused by external factors or a temporary workload spike, but it has since resolved.")
message_type = 'RESPONSE'

result = report_result(component=component, message=message, message_type=message_type)
print(result)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
post-storage-service (to trigger):

An investigation was conducted into potential latency or performance issues affecting external calls from the `Compose-Post-Service` to the `post-storage-service`. The findings are as follows:

1. **Latencies**:
   - **Read Latency**: Initial spikes were observed, peaking at approximately 33 ms (99th percentile). These later stabilized to around 9 ms.
   - **Write Latency**: High spikes were observed, reaching up to 158 ms (99th percentile). These later normalized to about 4-5 ms.

2. **Resource Utilization**:
   - **CPU Usage**: Stable and consistently low, indicating no CPU bottlenecks.
   - **Memory Usage**: Although there were fluctuations, memory remained within acceptable limits and did not show signs of resource contention.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The transient spikes in latency were not correlated with resource bottlenecks (CPU or memory). This suggests the issue was likely due to external factors or a temporary workload spike. The latency has since stabilized, and no ongoing performance degradation was observed.

The situation appears resolved, but continued monitoring is recommended to ensure stability.
