### Plan:

Task: Check the state of `compose-post-service` and ensure it meets the healthy state criteria (i.e., observed latency is below 1000ms).

Steps:
1. Query Prometheus to fetch the latency data for the `compose-post-service` using the provided PromQL query.
2. Check if the observed latency data meets the healthy state criteria (latency < 1000ms).
3. Report the result of the latency check.
4. If the service state is unhealthy, identify the root cause by investigating CPU, memory, and pod statuses (bonus: analyze resource configurations).

Let's begin with Step 1.

==================== Step 3 ====================

Next speaker: compose-post-service-assistant

compose-post-service-assistant (to compose-post-service-group-manager):

### Observations:
The latency values for `compose-post-service` in the last 5 minutes are as follows (in milliseconds):
- 91.50 ms
- 24.96 ms
- 24.82 ms
- 24.81 ms
- 79.75 ms
- 202.75 ms

All these values are significantly below the SLO threshold of 1000ms. Hence, the service meets the healthy state criteria.

### Step 3: Report the result.
```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import report_result

component = "compose-post-service"
message = (
    "The compose-post-service is healthy. All observed latency values are well below the 1000ms threshold."
)
message_type = "RESPONSE"

result = report_result(component=component, message=message, message_type=message_type)
print(result)
```

The `compose-post-service` is verified to be healthy as its latency is well below the SLO threshold. Task completed successfully.

TERMINATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: compose-post-service-code-executor

compose-post-service (to trigger):

The `compose-post-service` is in a healthy state. All observed latency values for the past 5 minutes are significantly below the 1000ms threshold, meeting the healthy state criteria. No further actions are required at this time.
