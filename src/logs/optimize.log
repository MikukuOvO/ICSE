    - If the latency has some fluctuations, you should consider the margin whether will reach the threshold. If not, just ignore it.
    - If the latency has shown increasing trend, you should estimate the time when it will reach the threshold. If more than 5 minutes, you should consider decrease resource allocation due to the furture optimization chance.
  4. Do not analysis the root cause of the unhealthy state, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
