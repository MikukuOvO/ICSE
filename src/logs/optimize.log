- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation.

# Other Requirements

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation as follows to save costs:
  - Sub-Step 3.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 3.2: If the resource usage is significantly lower than the allocated resources, consider decreasing the resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation as well as (75m for CPU and 96Mi for MEM) as the lower bound.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation as follows:
  - Sub-Step 4.1: Check the current resource allocation and usage.
  - Sub-Step 4.2: If the resource usage is significantly higher than the allocated resources, consider increasing the resource allocation, not larger than 2 times of the current allocation.

# Other Requirements
- Do not analyze the root cause for the SLO violation, just focus on the optimization of resource allocation.
- If some pods are in crashloopbackoff, it should be caused by the lack of resources. You should increase the resource allocation to fix the crashloopbackoff.

- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU and 64Mi for MEM.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU and 512Mi for MEM.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of resource allocation (CPU and MEM), such as image, env, replicas, etc.

- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 75m for CPU and 96Mi for MEM.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU and 512Mi for MEM.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of resource allocation (CPU and MEM), such as image, env, replicas, etc.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 100m for CPU and 128Mi for MEM.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU and 512Mi for MEM.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of resource allocation (CPU and MEM), such as image, env, replicas, etc.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU and 128Mi for MEM.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU and 512Mi for MEM.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of resource allocation (CPU and MEM), such as image, env, replicas, etc.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

2025-04-23 04:13:22,718 - optimize.py - INFO - Triggering task: TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n - This task is to optimize the resouce allocation of the microservice component that you are maintaining.
- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

2025-04-23 06:46:50,677 - optimize.py - INFO - Triggering task: TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n - This task is to optimize the resouce allocation of the microservice component that you are maintaining.
- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

2025-04-23 18:44:14,534 - optimize.py - INFO - Triggering task: TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n - This task is to optimize the resouce allocation of the microservice component that you are maintaining.
- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

2025-04-23 20:35:39,045 - optimize.py - INFO - Triggering task: TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n - This task is to optimize the resouce allocation of the microservice component that you are maintaining.
- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.

2025-04-24 17:34:22,132 - optimize.py - INFO - Triggering task: TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n - This task is to optimize the resouce allocation of the microservice component that you are maintaining.
- You will be given a Service Level Objective (SLO) and a set of metrics to monitor the health of the microservice component. Refer to the "Service Level Objective" section for the detailed SLO.
- Refer to the "Guidelines for Optimization" section for the steps to follow in order to optimize the CPU resource allocation.
- Refer to the "Other Requirements" section for any other requirements that you need to follow while performing the task.

# Service Level Objective
- The SLO for the microservice component is to maintain a latency of less than 200ms.
- The SLO is defined as the 95th percentile latency over a rolling 5-min window.

# Guidelines for Optimization
- Step 1: Monitor the metrics mentioned in the SLO and determine if the SLO is being met.
- Step 2: If the SLO is barely met, no action is needed.
- Step 3: If the SLO is met with a good margin, take action to decrease resource allocation with following rules to save costs:
  - Rule 1: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 1/2 of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When decreasing resource allocation, not smaller than 50m for CPU.
- Step 4: If the SLO is not met, take action to increase resource allocation with following rules to ensure the SLO is met:
  - Rule 1: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 2x of the current allocation.
  - Rule 2: When increasing resource allocation, not larger than 400m for CPU.

# Other Requirements
- Focus on the optimization of resource allocation, SLO violation are caused by the resource allocation.
- Not do modification on the deployment instead of CPU resource allocation, such as image, env, replicas, etc.
