Task: Check and report the health state of the ts-preserve-service component by querying relevant metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and workload, and analyze the results accordingly.

Steps:
1. Query the CPU usage metrics for ts-preserve-service using Prometheus to assess its current CPU consumption.
2. Query the memory usage metrics for ts-preserve-service using Prometheus to evaluate its memory consumption.
3. Query the latency metrics for ts-preserve-service using Prometheus to analyze its response time.
4. Query the workload metrics for ts-preserve-service using Prometheus to check the incoming traffic and workload.
5. Compile the results of these queries to form an overall health report of the ts-preserve-service based on its resource usage and response characteristics.

ts-preserve-service-assistant (to ts-preserve-service-group-manager):

The CPU usage data for the ts-preserve-service indicates stable consumption with values generally around 0.009 to 0.01 CPU seconds per execution period. There are occasional dips which may be worth monitoring further, but at present, the average values suggest that the CPU usage is within a normal operating range.

Let's proceed to query the memory usage metrics for the ts-preserve-service to continue our analysis.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'avg by (pod) (avg_over_time(container_memory_usage_bytes{pod=~"ts-preserve-service.*"}[1m]))'
memory_usage = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='40m', step='1m')
print(memory_usage)

==================== Step 4 ====================

Next speaker: ts-preserve-service-assistant

ts-preserve-service-assistant (to ts-preserve-service-group-manager):

The memory usage metrics for the ts-preserve-service show a relatively stable pattern with values ranging from approximately 519 MB to 522 MB. This indicates that there isn't much fluctuation or extreme consumption, suggesting that the memory usage is within a normal range for the service.

Next, let's query the latency metrics to understand the response time performance of the ts-preserve-service.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'histogram_quantile(0.90, sum(rate(istio_request_duration_milliseconds_bucket{destination_workload="ts-preserve-service"}[1m])) by (le))'
latency = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='40m', step='1m')
print(latency)

==================== Step 5 ====================

Next speaker: ts-preserve-service-assistant

ts-preserve-service-assistant (to ts-preserve-service-group-manager):

The latency metrics for the ts-preserve-service returned an empty result, which suggests that there might be no active traffic or requests being processed by the service during the observed time window. This is not necessarily an issue but indicates a lack of latency data to analyze.

As the next step, let's query the workload metrics to verify the incoming traffic and workload on the ts-preserve-service, which will help us confirm the absence of active traffic.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import query_prometheus

promQL = 'avg by (pod) (rate(istio_requests_total{destination_workload="ts-preserve-service"}[1m]))'
workload = query_prometheus(promQL=promQL, duration='40m', step='1m')
print(workload)
```

ts-preserve-service-assistant (to ts-preserve-service-group-manager):

The workload metrics for the ts-preserve-service also returned an empty result, confirming that there is no significant traffic or incoming workload to the service during the time window analyzed. This aligns with the absence of latency data, indicating that the service might currently be experiencing minimal use or idle conditions.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- **CPU Usage**: The CPU usage is stable, with negligible fluctuations, suggesting efficient resource consumption.
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption is consistent and falls within an acceptable range.
- **Latency**: No data was found, likely due to the absence of active requests or minimal traffic.
- **Workload**: Confirmed absence of workload, showing no active traffic being processed.

Overall, the ts-preserve-service component appears to be in a healthy state in terms of resource usage, although it's experiencing minimal traffic. Therefore, there are no immediate issues requiring attention based on the current metrics. Let me report this result.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_maintainer import report_result

component = 'ts-preserve-service'
message = 'The ts-preserve-service component is healthy with stable CPU and memory usage, but it currently has minimal or no traffic. No immediate issues detected.'
message_type = 'RESPONSE'
result = report_result(component=component, message=message, message_type=message_type)
print(result)
```

The ts-preserve-service component is currently in a healthy state. It exhibits stable CPU and memory usage, indicating efficient resource consumption. However, the service is experiencing minimal or no traffic, as evidenced by the absence of significant workload and latency data. There are no immediate issues requiring attention at this time.
