TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n This task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, without any other supplyementary information.

## Task Decomposition:
1. Assign the task of checking the state of each microservice component to all service maintainers.
2. Collect responses from all service maintainers.
3. If a service reports any issues, analyze the root cause by following the outlined steps in the task description.
4. Compile the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state based on collected data.

Let's start with Step 1 by assigning the task to check the state of each microservice component. 

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks
components = [
    'ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 
    'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service', 'ts-payment-service', 
    'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 
    'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service'
]
tasks = [
    'Check the state of the microservice component and report if healthy or not.'
] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

manager (to trigger):

To determine the state of the microservice components in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Check Component Health:**
   Verify the health status of each microservice component to confirm if it meets the healthy state criteria.

2. **Report Health Status:**
   - If none of the healthy criteria are violated, report the microservice as healthy.
   - If any criteria are violated, proceed to step 3.

3. **Analyze Unhealthy State:**
   - Identify the root cause for each component that is not meeting the healthy criteria. Focus on isolating the primary cause without attempting to fix it immediately.

4. **Report Root Causes:**
   Compile and report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state, formatted as:
   - **Root cause 1:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 2:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 3:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)

These steps ensure a systematic approach to diagnosing and reporting the condition of the components in your microservice architecture.

RESPONSE from component ts-admin-order-service: 
 The ts-admin-order-service is healthy. The CPU and memory usage are stable, the request workload is consistent, and the latency is mostly stable with a few occasional rises.
RESPONSE from component ts-admin-route-service: 
 The ts-admin-route-service is generally healthy. The pod is running with all containers ready, and resource usage for CPU and memory is stable. While request latency is overall acceptable, there are some intermittent spikes that might require monitoring.
RESPONSE from component ts-notification-service: 
 The ts-notification-service is healthy: Pods are running with stable CPU, memory usage in acceptable ranges, and latency within expected limits.
RESPONSE from component ts-auth-service: 
 The ts-auth-service is running normally with stable CPU and memory usage, and a consistent request rate. However, latency metrics are high and should be reviewed to ensure they meet acceptable thresholds. Overall, the service is currently healthy.
RESPONSE from component ts-order-service: 
 ts-order-service is operating healthily with stable CPU and memory usage, consistent latency, and normal workload demand.
RESPONSE from component ts-payment-service: 
 The ts-payment-service component is healthy. CPU, memory, latency, and workload metrics are within acceptable ranges.
RESPONSE from component ts-price-service: 
 The ts-price-service is healthy: Pod is running, resources are stable, and performance is within expected limits.
RESPONSE from component ts-route-service: 
 The ts-route-service microservice component is currently healthy with stable CPU and memory usage, consistent latency, and throughput.
RESPONSE from component ts-train-service: 
 The ts-train-service is healthy: CPU and Memory usage are within safe limits, latency is low, and workload appears manageable.
RESPONSE from component ts-travel-service: 
 The ts-travel-service component is healthy based on current metrics and pod status.
RESPONSE from component ts-ui-dashboard: 
 The ts-ui-dashboard component is generally healthy with stable CPU, memory usage, and workload performance. However, there are occasional high latency spikes that may require further investigation if they become more frequent.
RESPONSE from component ts-user-service: 
 All Prometheus metrics indicate ts-user-service is operating within normal parameters. Health check passes.

Next speaker: manager-planner

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

All microservice components have reported as healthy, with no violations of the healthy state criteria. Only occasional spikes in latency for `ts-admin-route-service`, `ts-auth-service`, and `ts-ui-dashboard` were noted, but these are not currently impacting overall health.

Given that all components are operating within their healthy thresholds, there is no need to analyze root causes for any unhealthy state.

`TERMINATE`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: manager-code-executor

manager (to trigger):

All microservice components are operating healthily, with stable resource usage and acceptable performance metrics. While there are some occasional spikes in latency for specific components like `ts-admin-route-service`, `ts-auth-service`, and `ts-ui-dashboard`, these instances are not currently affecting the overall health of the system. Therefore, no further action for root cause analysis is needed at this time.
