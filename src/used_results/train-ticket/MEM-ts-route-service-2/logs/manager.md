TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \nThis task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, WORKLOAD, ERRORRATE, without any other supplyementary information.

To address this task, I will assign the necessary steps to each of the service maintainers for checking the health of their respective microservice components. Here's how I plan to decompose the task:

Steps:
1. For each microservice listed, check the state to see whether the healthy state is maintained. (Assigned to each microservice maintainer)
2. Report back the results of the state check. If any service is found unhealthy, analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state without taking action to fix it.

I'll start by assigning the first step to all the service maintainers in the service_list.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks

components = ['ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service',
              'ts-payment-service', 'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service']
tasks = ['Check the state of your microservice component to ensure the healthy state is maintained.'] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

manager (to trigger):

To complete the task of managing the Kubernetes cluster and assessing the health of microservice components, follow these actions:

1. **Check Health**: Ensure the healthy state of each microservice component.
   - Evaluate critical metrics like CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, WORKLOAD, and ERRORRATE for any signs of compromise.

2. **If All is Healthy**:
   - Directly report the state as healthy.

3. **If Unhealthy**:
   - Analyze the root cause meticulously.
   - Identify top three root causes without attempting to fix them.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Present the top 3 root causes using the format:
     - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one from CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
     - Repeat for root causes 2 and 3.

Ensure each microservice component is evaluated and reported accurately for efficient management of the Kubernetes cluster.

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

All service components have been evaluated and provided responses regarding their health status. Here's a summary of their states:

- The majority of the microservice components, including `ts-admin-order-service`, `ts-admin-route-service`, `ts-notification-service`, `ts-order-service`, `ts-payment-service`, `ts-price-service`, `ts-train-service`, `ts-ui-dashboard`, and `ts-user-service`, have reported being in healthy states with metrics within normal ranges.

- `ts-auth-service` reported high latency that requires attention, though other metrics remain stable.
  
- `ts-route-service` has noted increases in CPU, memory utilization, and latency over the last 40 minutes, indicating potential concerns regarding resource management.

- `ts-travel-service` mentions occasional latency spikes, which suggests a need for further monitoring to avert possible service delays.

**Unhealthy State Root Causes Identified:**

- Root cause 1: `ts-auth-service` + LATENCY
- Root cause 2: `ts-route-service` + CPU
- Root cause 3: `ts-route-service` + MEMORY

Since the task of checking the state of the microservice components is completed and issues have been identified where necessary, we'll mark this task as complete. `TERMINATE`.
