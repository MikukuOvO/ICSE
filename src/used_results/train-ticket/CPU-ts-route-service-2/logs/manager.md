TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n This task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, without any other supplyementary information.

## Task Decomposition:
1. Assign the task of checking the state of each microservice component to all service maintainers.
2. Collect responses from all service maintainers.
3. If a service reports any issues, analyze the root cause by following the outlined steps in the task description.
4. Compile the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state based on collected data.

Let's start with Step 1 by assigning the task to check the state of each microservice component. 

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks
components = [
    'ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 
    'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service', 'ts-payment-service', 
    'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 
    'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service'
]
tasks = [
    'Check the state of the microservice component and report if healthy or not.'
] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

To determine the state of the microservice components in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Check Component Health:**
   Verify the health status of each microservice component to confirm if it meets the healthy state criteria.

2. **Report Health Status:**
   - If none of the healthy criteria are violated, report the microservice as healthy.
   - If any criteria are violated, proceed to step 3.

3. **Analyze Unhealthy State:**
   - Identify the root cause for each component that is not meeting the healthy criteria. Focus on isolating the primary cause without attempting to fix it immediately.

4. **Report Root Causes:**
   Compile and report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state, formatted as:
   - **Root cause 1:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 2:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 3:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)

These steps ensure a systematic approach to diagnosing and reporting the condition of the components in your microservice architecture.

RESPONSE from component ts-admin-route-service: 
 The ts-admin-route-service is mostly healthy. CPU and Memory usage are stable. However, latency is occasionally high, which might suggest performance issues. It is recommended to monitor and consider performance tuning.
RESPONSE from component ts-admin-order-service: 
 The ts-admin-order-service is operating within healthy parameters. CPU and memory usage are well below limits. Latency is under control with no significant spikes. Workload is stable, indicating moderate traffic without issues.
RESPONSE from component ts-auth-service: 
 The ts-auth-service is generally healthy. CPU and memory usage are stable. There are transient latency spikes that need further monitoring, but no immediate action is required.

==================== Step 5 ====================

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

Based on the responses from all service maintainers, here are the components that have reported potential issues or unhealthy states:

1. **ts-admin-route-service**: There are occasional high latency spikes.
2. **ts-auth-service**: There are transient latency spikes.
3. **ts-notification-service**: Slightly elevated latency is noted.
4. **ts-route-service**: High CPU usage and increased latency are reported.

Upon evaluation, the three notable root causes of the unhealthy states are as follows:

- **Root cause 1**: ts-route-service + CPU
- **Root cause 2**: ts-route-service + LATENCY
- **Root cause 3**: ts-admin-route-service + LATENCY

These root causes focus on the significant metrics that need attention across the services. Task completed. `TERMINATE`.

Next speaker: manager-code-executor

manager (to trigger):

Based on the analysis of the service components, the following issues have been identified:

1. **High CPU usage and increased latency** in the `ts-route-service` are impacting performance.
2. **Occasional high latency spikes** in the `ts-admin-route-service` may suggest performance tuning is needed.
3. **Transient latency spikes** in the `ts-auth-service` and slightly elevated latency in the `ts-notification-service` warrant further monitoring.

These components should be prioritized for performance optimization to ensure overall system health and efficiency.
