TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n This task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, without any other supplyementary information.

## Task Decomposition:
1. Assign the task of checking the state of each microservice component to all service maintainers.
2. Collect responses from all service maintainers.
3. If a service reports any issues, analyze the root cause by following the outlined steps in the task description.
4. Compile the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state based on collected data.

Let's start with Step 1 by assigning the task to check the state of each microservice component. 

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks
components = [
    'ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 
    'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service', 'ts-payment-service', 
    'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 
    'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service'
]
tasks = [
    'Check the state of the microservice component and report if healthy or not.'
] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

==================== Step 2 ====================

manager (to trigger):

To determine the state of the microservice components in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Check Component Health:**
   Verify the health status of each microservice component to confirm if it meets the healthy state criteria.

2. **Report Health Status:**
   - If none of the healthy criteria are violated, report the microservice as healthy.
   - If any criteria are violated, proceed to step 3.

3. **Analyze Unhealthy State:**
   - Identify the root cause for each component that is not meeting the healthy criteria. Focus on isolating the primary cause without attempting to fix it immediately.

4. **Report Root Causes:**
   Compile and report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state, formatted as:
   - **Root cause 1:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 2:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 3:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)

These steps ensure a systematic approach to diagnosing and reporting the condition of the components in your microservice architecture.

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

Based on the responses from the components about their health status, we have identified some issues that need further attention. The response indicates that there are two components experiencing problems:

1. **ts-notification-service:** 
   - There are latency spikes reaching up to 6000ms.

2. **ts-travel-service:** 
   - Performance issues with increased CPU usage, memory usage, and latency around 13:59 - 14:00 UTC.

**Steps for Further Action:**

### Analyzing Unhealthy State:
- Analyze the root cause of the latency spike in `ts-notification-service`.
- Analyze the root cause of increased CPU usage, memory usage, and latency in `ts-travel-service`.

Since the first three tasks have completed, I'll now proceed with assigning tasks to these two components to identify the root causes of their unhealthy statuses.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks

components = ['ts-notification-service', 'ts-travel-service']
tasks = [
    'Analyze the root cause of the latency spike in your component.',
    'Analyze the root cause of the increased CPU, memory usage, and latency during peak hours.'
]
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

==================== Step 6 ====================

Next speaker: manager-planner

manager (to trigger):

Based on the health status reports of our system's components, two areas require immediate attention:

1. **ts-notification-service** is experiencing latency spikes up to 6000ms. This issue needs to be analyzed to determine the root cause and implement a solution to manage the latency.

2. **ts-travel-service** has shown performance issues with increased CPU and memory usage, along with heightened latency between 13:59 - 14:00 UTC. A thorough investigation should be conducted to pinpoint the source of these issues and optimize resource utilization.

You might want to assign teams to investigate these issues promptly to maintain optimal system performance.

Next speaker: manager-planner

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

Based on the comprehensive analysis and responses from the components, here are the top 3 root causes for the identified unhealthy state:

1. **Root cause 1:** ts-notification-service has issues with CPU spikes that coincide with latency spikes, indicating that the CPU metric should be monitored closely.
   
2. **Root cause 2:** ts-travel-service is experiencing inefficiencies potentially related to request processing, evidenced by increased CPU and memory usage. The CPU metric is a primary concern here.

Since the task requests the top 3 root causes and we only have issues identified for two services, we'll provide only these identified causes:

- **Root cause 1:** ts-notification-service + CPU
- **Root cause 2:** ts-travel-service + CPU

Thus, out of all the services analyzed, these are the leading issues that need further investigation or remediation.

Based on the analysis of the system components, two primary issues have been identified that need further investigation:

1. **ts-notification-service:** This service exhibits CPU spikes that correspond with latency spikes, indicating a potential issue with resource management that should be closely monitored.

2. **ts-travel-service:** This service is experiencing increased CPU and memory usage coupled with higher latency, suggesting inefficiencies in request processing or resource handling. Potential areas for investigation include memory leaks, unoptimized processes, or CPU-intensive tasks.

Addressing these root causes will help in maintaining the overall health and performance of the system.
