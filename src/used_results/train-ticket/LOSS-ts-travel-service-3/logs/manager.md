TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \n This task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, without any other supplyementary information.

## Task Decomposition:
1. Assign the task of checking the state of each microservice component to all service maintainers.
2. Collect responses from all service maintainers.
3. If a service reports any issues, analyze the root cause by following the outlined steps in the task description.
4. Compile the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state based on collected data.

Let's start with Step 1 by assigning the task to check the state of each microservice component. 

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks
components = [
    'ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 
    'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service', 'ts-payment-service', 
    'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 
    'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service'
]
tasks = [
    'Check the state of the microservice component and report if healthy or not.'
] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

To determine the state of the microservice components in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Check Component Health:**
   Verify the health status of each microservice component to confirm if it meets the healthy state criteria.

2. **Report Health Status:**
   - If none of the healthy criteria are violated, report the microservice as healthy.
   - If any criteria are violated, proceed to step 3.

3. **Analyze Unhealthy State:**
   - Identify the root cause for each component that is not meeting the healthy criteria. Focus on isolating the primary cause without attempting to fix it immediately.

4. **Report Root Causes:**
   Compile and report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state, formatted as:
   - **Root cause 1:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 2:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)
   - **Root cause 3:** SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY)

These steps ensure a systematic approach to diagnosing and reporting the condition of the components in your microservice architecture.

We have received responses from all the microservice components. Based on the received information, here are the updates and next steps:

1. **Identified Issues:**
   - **ts-auth-service**: Experiencing high latency despite stable CPU and memory usage.
   - **ts-travel-service**: Reports increased latency issues starting at a specific timestamp, with reduced workload.
   - **ts-ui-dashboard**: Acknowledges issues without specific detail.

2. **Next Steps - Analyze Root Causes:**
   - For `ts-auth-service`: Analyze the root cause of the high latency issue.
   - For `ts-travel-service`: Investigate the cause of increased latency and reduced workload.
   - For `ts-ui-dashboard`: Identify and analyze the specific cause of the issues.

Let's assign the tasks to these respective components' maintainers to analyze and identify the root causes for their unhealthy states.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks

components = ['ts-auth-service', 'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard']
tasks = [
    'Analyze the root cause of the high latency issue.',
    'Investigate the cause of increased latency and reduced workload.',
    'Identify and analyze the specific cause of the issues.'
]

result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

Here are the identified root causes for the unhealthy state observed in the ts-auth-service, ts-travel-service, and ts-ui-dashboard components:

1. **Root cause 1: ts-auth-service + LATENCY**
   - High latency observed consistently at around 27-28 seconds. Suggested areas for further analysis include service dependencies or database interactions as potential contributors.

2. **Root cause 2: ts-travel-service + LATENCY**
   - A significant increase in latency is correlated with decreased workload/request rates, potentially due to network issues, service response delays, or external dependency problems.

3. **Root cause 3: ts-ui-dashboard + LATENCY**
   - Latency spikes have been noted, while CPU and memory usage, and workload are stable. Internal processing, network bottlenecks, or external dependencies may need further investigation.

These identified issues address the top root causes relating to latency within the specified services. The next steps should be focused on these areas to improve the components' performance.

To address the issues observed in various services:

1. **ts-auth-service** is experiencing high latency. It is recommended to analyze service dependencies or database interactions to identify potential contributors.

2. **ts-travel-service** shows increased latency correlated with decreased workload/request rates. Investigating potential network issues, service response delays, or external dependency problems is advised to improve processing capacity.

3. **ts-ui-dashboard** is experiencing latency spikes despite stable CPU and memory usage. Further exploration of internal processing, network bottlenecks, or external dependencies is necessary.

Focusing on these areas should help in enhancing the performance of the affected components.
