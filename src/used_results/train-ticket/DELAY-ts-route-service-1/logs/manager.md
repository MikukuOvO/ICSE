TASK: You are a manager of kubernetes cluster, you need to finish tasks for all components you maintaining with below: \nThis task is a detection for the state of your microservice component. 
# Follow the steps below to complete the task:
  1. Check the state of the microservice component to see if the healthy state is maintained.
  2. If NONE of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you can report healthy directly.
  3. If ANY of the above healthy state criteria is violated, you should follow the steps below:
    - Analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state. You should try your best to identify the root cause. DO NOT take any action to fix the unhealthy state.
    - You are allowed to repeat the above steps a few times to fix the unhealthy state.
  4. Finally, you should report the top 3 root causes of the unhealthy state you identified, with the corresponding format: 
    - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
    - Root cause 2: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
    - Root cause 3: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
  FYI: For the corresponding metric, you must choose one and only one of the following metrics: CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, WORKLOAD, ERRORRATE, without any other supplyementary information.

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

To address this task, I will assign the necessary steps to each of the service maintainers for checking the health of their respective microservice components. Here's how I plan to decompose the task:

Steps:
1. For each microservice listed, check the state to see whether the healthy state is maintained. (Assigned to each microservice maintainer)
2. Report back the results of the state check. If any service is found unhealthy, analyze the root cause of the unhealthy state without taking action to fix it.

I'll start by assigning the first step to all the service maintainers in the service_list.

```python
from intent_exec.agent.tool_functions_for_manager import assign_tasks

components = ['ts-admin-order-service', 'ts-admin-route-service', 'ts-auth-service', 'ts-notification-service', 'ts-order-service',
              'ts-payment-service', 'ts-price-service', 'ts-route-service', 'ts-train-service', 'ts-travel-service', 'ts-ui-dashboard', 'ts-user-service']
tasks = ['Check the state of your microservice component to ensure the healthy state is maintained.'] * len(components)
result = assign_tasks(components, tasks)
print(result)
```

==================== Step 2 ====================

Next speaker: manager-planner

manager (to trigger):

To complete the task of managing the Kubernetes cluster and assessing the health of microservice components, follow these actions:

1. **Check Health**: Ensure the healthy state of each microservice component.
   - Evaluate critical metrics like CPU, MEMORY, LATENCY, WORKLOAD, and ERRORRATE for any signs of compromise.

2. **If All is Healthy**:
   - Directly report the state as healthy.

3. **If Unhealthy**:
   - Analyze the root cause meticulously.
   - Identify top three root causes without attempting to fix them.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Present the top 3 root causes using the format:
     - Root cause 1: SERVICE NAME + CORRESPONDING METRIC (choose one from CPU/MEMORY/LATENCY/WORKLOAD/ERRORRATE)
     - Repeat for root causes 2 and 3.

Ensure each microservice component is evaluated and reported accurately for efficient management of the Kubernetes cluster.

RESPONSE from component ts-admin-order-service: 
 The ts-admin-order-service component is healthy with CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and workload within reasonable ranges.
RESPONSE from component ts-admin-route-service: 
 The ts-admin-route-service is generally healthy. Pods are running, CPU and Memory usage are within limits. However, there is a notable latency spike observed which requires further analysis. Workload levels are stable with a slight reduction recently.
RESPONSE from component ts-auth-service: 
 The 'ts-auth-service' is running normally. CPU and memory usage are stable, workload is consistent, and latency is generally stable except for some outliers. The component health is acceptable, but the latency spikes could be monitored further.
RESPONSE from component ts-notification-service: 
 The ts-notification-service is operational with stable CPU and memory usage, consistent workload, and generally acceptable latency, albeit with occasional spikes. It is maintaining a healthy state at present.

 The ts-price-service is currently healthy with stable CPU and memory usage, low latency, and consistent workload.
RESPONSE from component ts-route-service: 
 Pods for ts-route-service seem healthy with consistent CPU and memory usage. However, latency spikes were detected that could indicate external factors or dependencies affecting performance. Further investigation is recommended.

Next speaker: manager-planner

manager-planner (to manager-group-manager):

Based on the responses received from all microservice components, I have compiled the following observations and identified top root causes for the components that are not maintaining a completely healthy state due to latency issues:

- **Healthy Components**:
  - ts-admin-order-service
  - ts-auth-service
  - ts-notification-service
  - ts-order-service
  - ts-payment-service
  - ts-price-service
  - ts-train-service
  - ts-user-service

- **Unhealthy Components with Latency Issues**:
  1. **ts-admin-route-service**: Latency spikes were observed.
  2. **ts-route-service**: Detected latency spikes potentially due to external factors.
  3. **ts-travel-service**: Experienced intermittent latency spikes.
  4. **ts-ui-dashboard**: Observed latency spikes and a decrease in workload processing rates, suggesting performance issues.

**Reporting Top 3 Root Causes**:
1. Root cause 1: ts-admin-route-service + LATENCY
2. Root cause 2: ts-route-service + LATENCY
3. Root cause 3: ts-ui-dashboard + LATENCY

These identified root causes of latency issues should be further monitored and analyzed for underlying problems. For all other components, the system is running within acceptable health parameters. `TERMINATE`
